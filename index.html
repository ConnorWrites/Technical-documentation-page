      <section class="main-section" id="Common_Names"><header id="a" class="Common_Names">Common Names</header><h1>(Also known as:)</h1><code><p>The African polecat or Ictonyx striatus (its Latin / binomial name) is known by several other names such as: striped polecat, zoril, zorille, zorilla, Cape polecat, and African skunk.</p>
<p class="fun" ><p class="dyk"><em>Did you know?</em></p><p>The name "zorilla" comes from the word "zorro", which in Spanish means "fox".</p></p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Taxonomy"><header id="a" class="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</header><h1>(What kind of animal is it?)</h1><code><p>The name 'African Skunk' should give you a good idea of what animal it is, but here is the African polecat's taxonomy tree:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Domain: Eukaryota</li>
          <li>Kingdom: Animalia</li>
          <li>Phylum: Chordata</li>
          <li>Class: Mammalia</li>
          <li>Order: Carnivora</li>
          <li>Family: Mustelidae</li>
          <li>Genus: Ictonyx</li>
          <li>Species: I. Straitus</li>
          </ul></p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Description"><header id="a" class="Description">Description</header><h1>(What does it look like?)</h1><code><p>  African polecats are around 60-70 cm (24-28 in) in length when measured from the tip of their snouts to the end of their tails, and about 10-15 cm (3.9-5.9 in) tall from the ground to the shoulders.</p><p>They typically weigh from 0.6 to 1.3 kg (1.3 to 2.9 lb), with the males usually being the larger of the two sexes.</p><p>Their colouring varies by location, but they are generally black on the underside- including the legs and feet- white on the tail, with stripes running from their heads down their backs and on their cheeks.</p><p>Their skulls are around 56 mm (2.2 in) long, and they have unique face-mask colouring, often with a white spot on their heads, and white ears. These masks have long been thought to serve as a sort of warning to potential predators or enemies.</p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Distribution"><header id="a" class="Distribution">Distribution</header><h1>(Where can it be found?)</h1><img class="map" src="https://i.imgur.com/wYF7gUR.jpeg" alt="map" /><code><p>The African polecat predominantly lives in dry and arid climates, such as the savannahs and open country of Central, Southern, and sub-Saharan Africa, excluding the Congo basin and the more coastal areas of West Africa.</p><p>They are usually solitary, but can often be seen associating with other members of its species in small family groups or for the purpose of breeding.</p><p>They're also mostly nocturnal, active and hunting mostly at night. During the day, it can be found burrowed into the brush or sleeping in the burrows of other animals.</p><p>Most often, striped polecats are found in habitats with large ungulate populations, because of the lower level of shrubs where these grazers occur.</p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Diet"><header id="a" class="Diet">Diet</header><h1>(What does it eat?)</h1><code><p>Similar to other mustelids, the African polecat is carnivorous. Its diet includes various small rodents, snakes, birds, amphibians, and insects.</p><p>They have small stomachs, and therefore have to eat fairly often. Their clawed paws help them dig around in the dirt in search of their next meal.</p><p>Be warned: On top of other defenses, the African polecat has 34 sharp teeth which are great for shearing flesh and grinding meat, so they can deliver a nasty bite!
</p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Reproduction"><header id="a" class="Reproduction">Reproduction</header><h1>(Babies?)</h1><code><p>After the babies have been conceived, the gestation period is about one month (four weeks).</p><p>The gravid mother will prepare a nest for her babies, and take care of the completely vulnerable newborn polecats until the can fend for themselves.</p><p>Babies are born blind, deaf, and naked. One to five babies are commonly born per litter in the summer, and up to six can be supported at one time -if food for the mother is readily available- because the mother has six teats.</p></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Communication"><header id="a" class="Communication">Communication</header><h1>(What sounds do they make?)</h1><code><p>African polecats are known to cammunicate with each other with various signals and calls.</p><p>Mating calls between the sexes are common, and young polecats usually have their own set of calls and signals for communication which would differ when the mother is absent, either signalling joy or distress.</p><p>High-pitched screams and growls signal aggression, and undulating high-to-low screams are used to convey surrender or submission to adversaries.</p><p>Similar, though quieter, calls are used for friendly interactions.</p></code></section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Defense"><header id="a" class="Defense">Defense</header><h1>(How do they defend themselves?)</h1><code><p>African polecats can be quite territorial and aggressive, the mark their territories with feces (yes, that is poop) and with their anal spray like other skunks.</p><p>The spray, released from their anal stink glands can temporarily blind their enemies and irritate mucus membranes which also creates an intense burning sensation.</p><p>Before they spray, however, African polecats would often take a defensive stance, known as a deimatic stance, as a warning. Its back would be arched and its rear would be pointing to the opponent with its tail is straight up in the air.</p><p>Heed the warning and get away quickly or suffer the stinky spray!
